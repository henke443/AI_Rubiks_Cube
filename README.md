# Under construction
I almost had it before but I wasn't satisfied so this project is in the **very alpha** stage.

Once I'm done I will remove all the clutter and create clean and good code.

I might as an bonus try to create not only a Rubik's solver but a solver that can transition between any two states in a somewhat minimal amount of moves, so you can create cool animations by writing letters on a 4x4 cube for example.
