Idea now:

1. Shortest path generator would be ideal but basically impossible to do it seems
2. For now generate random 20 len move set
3. The learn to predict the action probability from that moveset.
4. The action probability is determined by appending the whole graph to a MCGS, all solutions in the original 20 move set graph have a higher prior
5. Priors are also generated by the value function
6. We should probably from each 



Process 1:
    Start at move 20 in graph, run value function on each possible state from all 12 moves
    Sample one action according to prior value and UCB (based on visited_count and value)
    If state is same as existing node then 
    Perform Process 1 on sampled action until the distance is 20 or terminal state is reached (cube is solved).
